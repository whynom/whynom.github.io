mv command🔗\nThe mv command moves a file or directory from one place to another.  The rsync command does the same thing, but it can also show progress which is particularly useful for moving things between a local computer and a server.  Rsync can also sync things in such a way that if a certain move is taking a very long time it can be halted and picked up later.\nI'm going to make a mvto command that's a Rust application that basically does rsync -avz --progress --delete-source-files thing-to-move destination.\nWhy Rust?🔗\nBecause it's what I'm trying to learn, and there's no better way than doing.  This could probably be done with a simple shell script, or maybe an alias, but as I add more and more to it, there's a possibility that the crustiness of bash will start to outweigh the added complexity of doing something dead simple in a full programming language like Rust.\nA command line program🔗\n\n\nThe Command struct\n\nThat import at the top gives us access to the Rust struct Command.  According to the documentation.\nA process builder, providing fine-grained control over how a new process should be spawned.\nThe term process as it's used here means process your computer runs.  In my parlance, I like to think of it as it'll do a command line command.  It'll run ls or rm as a child command and can take the output from those commands and do stuff with it in Rust.\n\nCommand::new(\"ls\").output()\n\nThis just runs the ls list command sets the output of that command to the output variable.\n\nprintln!(\"stdout: {}\", String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;output.stdout));\n\nThis prints the output from the ls command we've run as a child process of our Rust application\nAdding some arguments🔗\nThe only change here is adding the arg methods to the command to give our ls command some arguments.\n\nBut when making our eventual rsync like command, we'll have to feed in some arguments during the running of the application that can't be hardcoded into the program like -l and -R are here.  To do this, we'll have to capture user inputs.\nCapturing user inputs🔗\nWe need to pull in the env module to collect the arguments from the command line and import Path to double check the directory we're trying to list is in fact a directory.\n\nTo collect all the arguments given we use the collect method as follows.\n\nThe collect method actually takes in the application name's on the cli as the first argument, but because I'm talking about the arguments given to the application, I'm calling the first_arg the second string in the collection.  I think it's not the right thing to do, but here we are.\nWe then want to check to make sure we have a directory to feed to our ls command.\n\nWe'll do the ls command on the directory if it is, but if not, we'll just say it's not a directory.\n\nAs the program is now it can take a directory as a user input but if no directory is given, it'll ungracefully error.  We could make it ls the local directory when run without an argument, but enough playing around with ls, let's start with the rsyncing.\nVery basic rsync functionality.🔗\nWe're getting rid of the directory checking, so we've removed the Path import and the if statement logic.  We change the command to rsync, add the desired arguments and voila, we've got a very basic rsync command.\n\nThe spawn method and showing the rsync progress.🔗\nWhile the above works, it won't show a progress bar.  The reason for making this application is to more or less improve upon the standard mv command, and showing that progress bar was one of the improvements\n\nThis shows the progress, but after it runs, it won't quit the rust application.\nLooking at the Command::spawn documntation, we get the following explanation.\nExecutes the command as a child process, returning a handle to it.\nBy default, stdin, stdout and stderr are inherited from the parent.\nWhat I think this means is that it's inheritance of stdout means it shows this new child process in our terminal and thus shows the progress bar.  Success but the application hangs.\nWhen using this application now it completes the moving of the file but the application doesn't stop, it just keeps going.\nProgress and quiting🔗\nLet's make our command a mutable variable and run the wait method on it.\n\nAfter running the rsync command our application ends, as we want.\nstd::process::Child documentation has the following note.\nWaits for the child to exit completely, returning the status that it exited with.\nMy meager understanding leads me to believe that when we run the spawn method it produces a child process that never stops.  The wait method gives us some result from that process thereby ending the the running of our code.\nEither way, we've got what we want.\nWas it worth it?  What's next?🔗\nThis very easily could have been an alias in a .bashrc but making a Rust program allows us to expand further on our usecase and go beyond what rsync offers.  My next goal will be to make our mvto command remove the empty directories that get left behind when using --remove-source-files.\nI'm a little reluctant to play around with destroying things, and I suspect this is why rsync doesn't have it built in but it's what I want and Computers should do exactly what I want, not just what other programmers have given me.\n","id":"https://whynom.github.io/blog/a-rust-cli-application/","title":"Easy script in Rust"},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/binary-search-grokking-algorithms/":{"body":"Guess my number🔗\nIf I play a guessing game with you where you have to guess the number I'm thinking of between 0 and 100, and after each guess I tell you if the number is higher or lower, what's the best strategy?\nLet's first talk about what's likely the worst strategy.  The worst strategy is:\nYou: 1\nMe: Higher\nYou: 2\nMe: Higher\nYou: 3\nIt's apparent without much thought that this could take up to 101 guesses, and it is generally just a bad strategy.  Even if my number is 1, it's, generally speaking, a bad strategy.\nThe best strategy🔗\nThis may not be as apparent straight off the top of your head, but the best strategy is the following.\nYou: 50\nMe: Higher\nYou: 75\nMe: Lower\nYou: 62\nMe: Higher\nYou: 68\nMe: You got it!\nIt's just apparent that if you keep cutting the remaining numbers in half and guessing the middle number, you're throwing away the largest amount of numbers you can each guess, until you get down to so few remaining number, you have but 1, or stumble upon the correct one on the way to that last standing number.\nLet's code it, tests first.🔗\n\nWe want to make a function binary_search that satisfies those tests.  Give the function a number, and it tells you the array index.  Give the function the number 3 and it tells you it's array index is 1. Give it -1 which doesn't exist, it gives you None.\nBinary search function🔗\n\nThis function is pretty self-explanatory.  Give it an array, give it an item, which is what it looks for, and it will spit out the array index, using the algorithm described earlier.  This function and idea were taken from the book Grokking Algorithms.  In fact, I'll be using this to grok algorithms amazingly enough, so I'll be citing this book a lot in future writings.\nLet's spice it up🔗\nI want more information, I don't just want the index, I want how many guesses and which guesses were made.  When I made that guessing game example at the top of this writing, I just halved the difference and added or subtracted from or to the lower number or higher number.  Is that really exactly what's going on?\nI'm terribly afraid of things like the fencepost error and casually rounding and other such errors when doing rote Math off the top of my head.  Let's make the computer do the rote math.\nLearning some new Python tricks🔗\nFirst off, I sure as heck don't want to write an array with [0, 1, 2, 3, ... 100].  I don't want to type out 100 numbers.  That's madness.  Computer do it for me!\n\nThe ole' LLM machine tells me that's how you do it.  To me it reads a little clunky because the list doesn't really include the 101, but I'm gonna leave dogs lying down and all that.\nApparently in Python, they call arrays lists, or really there is something called an array, but it's part of a module or something.  I'm just gonna call these collections arrays.  And probably lists sometimes.  Enjoy.\nMy function🔗\nFirst things first, I want to see how many guesses my algorithm takes.  It's easy enough to add.\n\nAnd, of course the test to go along with it.\n\nNow what are the guesses?🔗\nI've expanded upon the function to be able see how many guesses it takes to find the index, but I'd also like to see what guesses the algorithm makes before it gets to its answer.  I'd like to see if the guessing game example at the top of this writing made sense!  I did it right off the top of my head, so maybe it doesn't!\nlet's find out\nFirst sauce up our testarooney\n\nI realized my naming convention of calling the number of guesses just plain guesses really threw a wrench in my hammer.  I updated it to a better name and added a variable which is more appropriately called guesses\n\nFinal thoughts🔗\nSo my initial example at the top was correct.  Is this because I'm a genius?  Well, head size is correlated to intelligence and I'm basically an Easter Island statute, so I'll let you put too and too together.\nGithub Repo with all the finalized code.\n","id":"https://whynom.github.io/blog/binary-search-grokking-algorithms/","title":"Binary Search Grokking Algorithms"},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/didset-willset/":{"body":"didSet🔗\nIt probably wasn't the first time I saw this function, but in the GRBD demo app, I saw this pice of code.\n\nIt seems that didSet just fires off that closure the observePlayers function is in, but what is it doing more than just having that function within the Ordering.byScore closure?\nMy first attempt🔗\nInitially I tried the following\n\nThis fails.  The didSet function can't just run in app's general scope, it needs to be brought up in a class so that it's being held in device's memory.\nI don't understand on device memory🔗\nI think when a class or a struct is initialized they are stored in the device's memory or in the stack or both, or something like that.  When I run the above test the code is just executed, but there's no way for a function like didSet to remain running and observing for a change in the numberOfCows variable.  It needs to be within a class (maybe it can also work in a struct?) so that that when that class is initialized and stored in the device's memory, it can remain \"running\".\nAgain, this is all very vague and not well understood by me, but this is what I'm thinking right now.  Anyway, on to trying to put it in a class\nI thought you had class!  I thought you had class!@🔗\nThis next test shows proper usage and where exactly didSet fires.\n\ndidSet fires whenever the numberOfCows property on the countingCows class changes.  As the test shows, it fires after the setting, so when we changed numberOfCows to 999, it fired the didSet code block to add 1 more cow and ending up with 1000 cows.\nOne wonders what should be done if we wish to execute a block of code before a property is changed.\nwillSet🔗\nThis function does the same thing as didSet except it does it just before a property is changed.  Making the following example does not show it doing anything different from the didSet function because I couldn't think of one.  Maybe, some day, I'll run into a situation where I need a willSet, or maybe I'll stumble upon some code where it is needed but for now, bask in my ignorance!\n\nThis is example can be a bit less confusing because willSet is not running a code block that changes itself, it changes the numberOfChanges variable instead.\nBack to that original code🔗\nI more or less kind of understood what the original code was doing but I have a better grasp about how didSet has to be a function on a property in a class.  Originally, I was kind of thinking why not just define a closure on the byScore property but that would only fire once and not on updates.  It'd probably add more complexity to the byScore property as well as making the calling of it more difficult to read.\n\nSome final notes🔗\nI realized that I was thinking of them and referring to them as functions, but it appears they are observers.\nYou can't have an observer on a lazy property which intuitively feels right because lazily stored properties don't exist when the class they are a part of is initialized, thus these observers would have nothing to observe.  It seems like a syntax thing to protect against programmer errors.\nThere's also different kinds of observers for computed properties which are get and setwhich I've certainly seen, and to some point understood, like I did didSet and willSet but I should probably throw together another branch and essay to get a better full idea of using them.  I did not realize they were used only on computed variables.\nrepo\n","id":"https://whynom.github.io/blog/didset-willset/","title":"didSet, and eventually willSet"},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/get-and-set-in-swift/":{"body":"AI steers me right, and steers me wrong🔗\nI wrote a nifty article about didSet and willSet.  They're observers you can put on a property that execute a block of code whenever the property they're attached to changes.  While jumping down that well, my AI sidekick was the one that gave me the classification of these keywords which is observers.  Personally, I love to know what a thing in programming is called.  I sometimes find myself trying to describe a group of programming things and I don't have the word for them.  didSet and willSet aren't really functions but I need to mention them in tandem, so having the term observer is quite useful.\nAs useful as the ole' AI was with enlightening me about observers, it told me that get and set are the observers for computed properties, as didSet and willSet can't be used on get and set.  It was wrong, but nevertheless, I plunged into it to figure out exactly what these... functions(?) keywords(?) XCode pink words(?) are all about.  I've seen them before, and I had the gist, but it turns out my gist was somewhat inaccurate.\ncomputed variables as syntactic sugar for functions🔗\nMy understanding of computed variables in the Swift language was that they were functions.  Without a defined get and set, they very much appear that way.  Let's take a look.\n\nWell lookie here.  Either way I make a money struct, whether I use a computed variable or a function that almost exactly mimics it, it gives the exact same result, it's just some different syntax.  It looks like my gut reaction was right!\nBut wait, computed variables have a get and set🔗\nThe previous example of a computed property is actually what the swift book refers to as a read only computed property, which will hopefully make sense after going through the following example I lifted from the  swift book\nThe Rectangle🔗\nIn this example, we're going to make a rectangle.  We'll give it an origin and a size, and it will give us a center.  For us to define an origin, we need a point.\nLet's get to the point🔗\nHere's how we'll define a point, like the one you used to see in math class on a cartesian plane.\n\nGive me an x and a y and I'll give you a Point.\nSize🔗\nGive me a width and height, and I'll give you the Size of a rectangle.\n\nPoint and Sizes lead to the Rectangle🔗\nFinally,\n\nHere we see our get and set keywords in action.  Once we've made a Rect we get computations on our origin and size that give us the center.\nAccessing the center🔗\nWhenever we access the center, it'll run the code block in the curly braces following the get keyword.  Let's test this theory.\n\nWhen we're accessing the center, which we didn't define upon making the Rect, it runs that code block after the get key word and returns to us a Point with a center that has an x at 5, and a y at 5.\nSetting the center🔗\nNow we're going to tell our Rect instance what the new center is, and it's going to execute the code block after the set keyword to change the center of our rectangle and make a new rectangle from which we can give the new origin\n\nWhen we set that center property, the code block after set in our Rect is executed and it returns to us the new origin.\nFinal thoughts🔗\nThis is pretty basic stuff but I feel like going through it step by step, making tests, writing everything out gives me a better and more solid understanding.  Computed variables aren't just syntactic sugar for a function, they're their own thing.  The set and the get make them unique and different from a function, and knowing that gives me another tool to use if I should ever run into something that needs the unique use of the get set on a computed variable.\n","id":"https://whynom.github.io/blog/get-and-set-in-swift/","title":"Get and Set on computed variables in Swift"},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/impetus-for-using-grdb/":{"body":"Core Data is painful🔗\nWhen I first semi-earnestly started trying to program, Core Data was Apple's answer for persisting data between app usages.  I never did anything fancy with it, but it did get the job done for me once upon a time.\nThe problems I had with it were that a lot of it was in the XCode gui and that it had some technical baggage.\nDoing anything not in text while trying to make a program, or when doing something programmatically, is a real pain.  I guess it's supposed to be beginner user friendly, and maybe avoid errors with typos, especially when you define things with strings, but it has huge downsides.\nWhen you truly are a beginner, learning things within a gui instead of with text means you have to see it.  You have to watch a video of someone clicking the correct box or at least have an image of someone doing it.  The worst part of this is that IDE's interfaces change pretty frequently.  An article or youtube video showing you where the checkbox is for one-to-many for a Cord Data instance isn't necessarily exactly where it was one year ago.\nCore Data was implemented when Objective-C was the language used for creating iOS and other Apple operating programs.  This lead to some awkwardness with things like optionals once we get to the Swift language era.  Optionals in Swift mean one thing and optionals in Core Data mean another thing, and this can lead to confusion.\nI only ever used Core Data for very simple needs, so my take on it is certainly not definitive and, on the bright side, it's my understanding that Core Data is very mature and thus works very well.  It's rock solid.\nSwift Data🔗\nThe real upside of SwiftData is that it's all in words.  It's all in text.  There's no more clicking a certain box to get a one-to-many relationship.\nIt's also modern.  It's swifty, meaning it was made to be used in Swift and follows its standards.\nThe downsides I ran into is that, when I did use it, it was hard to find any detailed information.  Most information I would stumble upon for using SwiftData was about doing the following:\n\nMaking persistent data\nOne to many relationships\nMigration\nStoring data in iCloud\n\nIt does all those things with aplomb, but if I were trying to do things that are more complicated, I'm not even sure where to look.  I admit, I never tried very hard as I never needed to do anymore than the above.\nGRDB🔗\nGRDB is a framework used to read and write from SQLite databases.  It's mature, well maintained and well documented.  Stepping out of very basic use cases into more complicated areas makes GRDB more pleasant to use than Core Data and SwiftData.\nMy love affair with databases🔗\nAt a previous job excel was our main tool.  It was mostly used as a visualization tool with very few computational functions to process data.  I was not the one responsible for those functions and they ended up being very brittle.  I'm not blaming the person who made the functions for this brittleness, it seems to me that that's just a trait of excel in general.\nBy brittleness I mean if there was a space at the end of a number, a function may not work.  If a number had a dot at the end of it, it would act bizarrely.  It would be insane for me to list more problems as most office workers understand that excel stinks in many ways.  It's amazing and powerful, especially for those who don't necessarily want to write a lot of code to get something working, but it's also... the bane of every office workers existence.\nIn steps SQLite🔗\nSo I wanted to start automating some processes at my previous job.\nI often would have to send some piece of excel data to someone else.  I'd have to copy and paste the data, write some pretty rote words, and then format everything so it was okay.  Very boring, very repetitive.\nI found out that to do things like write boilerplate emails, check for certain pieces of data and so on, I could use a mixture of SQLite, Python, the pandas framework and some other python libraries that hooked into the Windows operating system.\nEverything unlocked.  On top of that, just using a database was pretty much superior to excel.  Specifically, even without any real programming experience, I think someone could use SQLitebrowser better than they could excel.  It's true excel can make colors and bold and all that jazz, but with sqlitebrowser, someone can quite easily give every text with the word \"empty\" in it or get the sum, or average of a column or a million other things with just a very simple SQL query.\nGRDB🔗\nOkay, now GRDB.\nGRDB has the upsides of beubg mature and well documented but also detailed when it needs to be.  The reason I even went searching for something was because I knew I was going to be making a program heavily based on using a huge chunk of data in SQLite format.  I was going to need to import that giant database, update it between program versions and probably migrate quite a lot.  I'm sure SwiftData and Core Data can do this because they are also, as far as I know, based on SQLite.  The problem is, and especially with SwiftData, they are more aimed at ease of use over complex operations.  This leads to a lot of the information on how to use these tools being about very basic needs.  GRDB has a lot of documentation and a lot of users who've asked questions and answered various methods of doing very complicated and useful use cases.  Use cases much greater than what I need.\nFinal words🔗\nLooking back, most of what I've gone over was the negatives of Core Data and SwiftData.  I knew there were alternatives but I used them because I thought they were the standards and thus time well spent.  Now that I've matured as a programmer, I see that learning more complex frameworks and libraries isn't as hard as I thought and, in fact, have a lot of advantages.  I doubt I'll ever look into the actual code behind GRDB, but I could if I wanted to.  There's a lot of documentation, there's a lot of community, and there are people actively developing GRDB!\nIt's hard to describe the kind of relief I get knowing that I've found the way to persist data in Apple operating systems.  When I started programming the two biggest obstacles outside of actually writing code were making a UI and dealing with persistent models.  There was always an awkwardness with them. The problems I'd have to clear with those two areas were always annoying and felt like they were sucking the joy out of making programs.  I'm comfortable enough with SwiftUI to not feel that pain in the UI area any more, and now I feel like, once I really get my feet wet with GRDB, persistent data will also feel very doable.\n","id":"https://whynom.github.io/blog/impetus-for-using-grdb/","title":"Impetus for Using GRDB"},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/my-first-github-repo/":{"body":"I added something\nI recently released my first github repo which is two functions that wrap around a some keychain functions so that someone can store a string on a users iOS (should be any Apple device) and save that information between user installations.  My impetus being, I wanted to make it so I can have someone use my app once, and then have to pay to get more uses.  I didn't want them to be able to get the free use, and then uninstall and reinstall and get another free use.\nThe app is extremely basic.  It's basically doing a math problem, and giving a pretty chart or two to show the output of the math.  The suggestion from my buddy, LLM, was to set up a server that tracked users' use, which was entirely way too much work for such a simple app.  A reason I like developing for Apple devices is they give me a lot, and I didn't want to go down the rabbit hole of setting up and mainting a server.  The server would most likely be more work than the app.\nThe one pitfall of useing the keychain to track usage is that if someone installs my app on their iPhone, and then on their iPad, they do, indeed, get another free use.

A very quick run down is that the algorithm picks an element of the collection, a pivot, then goes through each number in the collection and puts that number in either a collection of lesser or a collection of greater than the pivot number.  You then take the collection of lesser numbers, add the pivot to that collection, and then add the greater collection, thereby making one big collection with all the lesser numbers before the pivot number, and all the greater numbers after the pivot number.\nThe collections with the lesser and greater numbers are themselves not sorted, so you run the algorithm on each of those collections recursively until you end up with one collection that is in ascending order.\nPhew...\nIf you don't know what the quicksort algorithm is, that didn't help, but if I ever come back to this writing, hopefully it will remind me.\nThe algorithm in Python code🔗\nI certainly didn't come up with this code all on my own, rather I lifted it from Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Y. Bhargava.\n\nThat was actually tough for me to fully comprehend because of the way they set the less and great variables, but not too bad.\nWhat do I want to take in, and what do I want to spit out?🔗\nThere are arrays, which I think I will sparsely ever use as they are of a fixed number of elements.  Then there are Vectors which can have the number of elements as well as the elements themselves changed.  Vectors seem to be of the type I'm used to using, basically a collection you can change and play with.\nThen there are array slices.  Array slices are references to a certain part of an array OR vector.  They seem pretty versatile as a function that has an argument of the type array slice can take an array, a vector or indeed an array slice.\nDue to the versatility of array slices I decided my quicksort function would take in and spit out array slices.\nSnags🔗\nI ran into some pretty basic snags that come from using a language that has references and borrowing.  This is something I'm not accustomed to so I think it's right an proper I ran into these problems.\nDereferencing🔗\nThe first hiccup I ran into was grabbing the pivot element.  I'm taking in an array slice of i32 integers, &amp;[i32], and spitting out the same type.  So when I get the pivot element, I want it to be of the type i32 but the following gives me a reference to an i32 type, not an i32.  This means later when I try to make a collection of the &amp;[i32] type at the end to spit out of my function, I can't use this pivot because it's of the type &amp;i32.\n\nSo how do I get out of such an insane bind? Well, I dereference it.\n\nI haven't gotten to the dereferencing section of the rust book, so I had the LLM whip this up for me.  If the arr doesn't have any elements this should panic with the message \"Array is empty\", but this plucking of the pivot element is after an if statement checking for an empty (or single element) array.\nReturning a value referencing data owned by the current function🔗\nI also ran into this pretty rookie mistake.  I'm trying to return a reference that is owned by a variable.  I'm not 100% comfortable with this understanding but hopefully as I run into it more and more often, I'll have a better feel for this.\n\nConclusion🔗\nThe real lesson I learned is that having a whole new set of types that are references is tough.  I'm a Swifter and I like type safety.  I like types.  I decided to do Grokking Algorithms with Rust instead of Python because I find Python's dynamic typing obnoxious, but it appears I've bit off more than I can lear (easily).\n","id":"https://whynom.github.io/blog/quick-sort-and-lessons-learned/","title":"Quicksort and memory stuff in Rust"},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/swift-app-without-xcode-but-with-testing/":{"body":"My quick foray into the Rust programming language.🔗\nThere is no end of people that will sing the praises of Rust, and not without reason.  I do not care too much for the common things many seem to go gaga about, namely memory management that avoids a whole category of errors and small binary sizes.  I don't care about these things because I've never run into these problems.  This is probably because I've never worked on a big complicated codebase.\nThere are several things I did go gaga about: extremely clear error messages, an overbearing warning system and a quick and easy way to whip up a new program with testing.  That last point is what I'm going to get into with Swift.\nXCode you are but my enemy🔗\nI like emacs.  I hate XCode.  XCode forces me to use a bunch of GUI checkboxes to tick in favor of direct text I can more easily examine and debug.  I also can't customize it nearly to the degree to which I can customize emacs.\nThis added up to me wanting to just quickly whirl up a program to test some code outside of whatever application I was working on being a nuisance of making a new XCode project, going through its rigmarole and then finally ending up with having to produce my quick code and tests in an IDE I do not favor.\nWhat I aim to do here is show a way to clearly and quickly setup a space for testing code with swift-testing so I can play around and test out code in the text editor of my choice, emacs.\nWhip up that basic application🔗\nFirst let's make a new directory for our app I'm going to call quickApp and go into that new directory and make our new application.\n\nThis gives us a Swift application that we can run with swift run while we are in our quickApp root directory.  When we do so we get greeted with the classic \"Hello, world!\".  So far so good.\nThe given boilerplate code🔗\nIf you do a quick ls you can see that our quickApp directory has a Sources directory with a main.swift file.  The code in that file is where we get our \"Hello, world!\" print.  This file is where we put all the code we want to run.\nThe other file you'll find in your quickApp directory is Package.swift.  This is where we define our application setup like targets and dependencies.  This is where I will sing the praises of Rust yet again.  The Rust setup file is a very straight forward .toml file.  The Swift Package.swift setup file is decidedly more complicated, especially for a quick and dirty setup that we're going for.  Let's explore it now.\n\nIt's not super complicated but it wasn't trivial for me to setup with just the swift-testing library import and implementation.\nPackage.swift🔗\nLet's add the following to our Package.swift file to target MacOS.\n\nI'm targeting the mac platform because I'm using a mac and I want to run code quickly and iteratively.  I don't want to pop open an iOS simulator or anything like that.  We're not looking to make a cross platform amazing program, we're trying to make some kind of very quick application for which we can write tests right off the bat and test things.\nNow add the swift-testing dependency.\n\nWe can do a quick swift run and the dependency will be downloaded and put into our program.  There will be a warning\n\nThis makes sense because we haven't added the dependency to our testing target yet. Let's do that now.\ntargets🔗\nBefore actually adding the Tests target, a quick word about targets.  They are basically a way of grouping code.  There's the executable target, which is the code for the actual program you're writing, and we're going to add another large group of code separate from the code we're actually writing for the application.  We're adding code which will be used for testing and will not be usable in the actual executable code.\nThis has the benefit of separating our test functions from the functions we actually want to run in the program.  I actually personally don't like this because it adds a level of complication that could just be solved by naming testing functions appropriately with test in their name or by making tests have to be run in an instantiation of a testing class or something, but I'm sure there are a million reasons why I'm wrong about that.\nSo what we want in the end is for the testing code to not be executable in our executable code but we do want our executable code to be runnable in our testing target because we need the tests to be able to run those functions to test them.\nTesting target🔗\nLet's add a tests directory for our testing target.\n\nNow we can add our testing dependency.\n\nA few notable things.\nFirst, you'll notice that our new test target has a dependency and it's the quickApp itself.  As stated before our testing code needs to be able to run our executable's code to be able to test that code.\nNext, you'll see that we've defined a path for our testing files.  It's in the Tests directory we made before.  We don't have this path in our executable target because we have all of our code for executable in our quickApp/Sources directory which is the default.\nLastly, we say we want to have access to the swift-testing package so we can use that library in our testing files.\nMaking and running basic tests🔗\nAdd a file for our tsting code in our tests directory.\n\nWhen I'm making a new testing file I like to test the testing file by having a test that should fail, and a test that should pass.  Add the following code to the new quickAppTests file.\n\nChange to the quickApp root directory and run our tests\n\nYou should get a result in your terminal telling you that our helloIsNotGoodbye function failed and our oneIsOne function passed.\nConclusion🔗\nThis is quite a bit of work for doing something that should be a simple command line command but it gets me the desired result, a place I can put code and a place I can test that code.  I can also do this all in emacs which I'm constantly in anyway, so I don't have to mess around with XCode.\nI also feel like this is still simpler than the XCode route that requires me to check boxes, possibly uncheck certain boxes, and gives me bunch of UI boilerplate code in a few files I'll never need.\nIn the end, I'd like to make a script that does all of the above, or even possibly a swift application that does because my distate for XCode does not extend to the actual Swift code I feel comfortable with and enjoy writing.\nFinished code🔗\nPackage.swift🔗\n\nquickApp.swift🔗\n\n","id":"https://whynom.github.io/blog/swift-app-without-xcode-but-with-testing/","title":"A quick swift application setup with testing without using XCode"},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/the-basics-of-zola/":{"body":"Zola🔗\nZola is a static site generator written in the Rust programming language.  I've used Hugo a lot before but I always felt like I could barely stumble together a website, and after leaving a Hugo website for a while, I'd come back and it wouldn't work.  This is probably more due to something I was doing rather than whatever was going on with Hugo but I thought I'd change it up just because I might as well.\nI should also point out, I've never used any of the Go underpinnings of Hugo.  I've never used Go, I don't understand it's semantics or anything, so whatever programming language a static site is based upon makes no difference to me.  The confusion for me always lay at the templating level of static sites.  I decided to go with Zola because all else being equal, I'll take the static site generator written in a language I'm trying to learn.  Why not?\nWell it turns out there's a huge benefit to using a static site generator written in Rust; the error outputs.  Rust has really good and easy to read errors, and using Zola, it also gives really good easy to read error outputs.  Awesome.\nStatic site generator formats🔗\nI've used Hugo in the past, and while I like it, I never quite understood all of the templating and use of blocks and where blocks got replaced and all that.  I was able to limp my way through everything with a mix of minimal understanding and trial and error, but I never quite understood everything.  After going through Zola's documentary overview  with my AI buddy, I finally understand.\nI'm going to write this explaining all the confusing parts of that overview of how templates and blocks work as best I can.  I'm skipping all the install explanation.\nSections🔗\nThis was initially very confusing to me.  What is a section? I think it's best understood with a solid example.\nI want my webpage to have several pages.  The initial landing page, but I'd also like a blog page.  That blog page is going to have the title and the first 5 lines of my 5 most recent blog posts, or maybe my 3 most popular blog posts, or maybe even the whole of my 3 most recent blog posts , but the point is it will contain links to other pages and I have to get my hands on something that can represent the collection of all my blog posts so I can tell Zola which ones I want to show, in what order and to what extent (like the whole post or just a summary with a title).\nThat collection of all my blog posts is called a section.\nA section is really a collection of pages.  Although when I go to the my-website.com/blog page, that is a page, when it shows me some collection of my posts, of the type blog, it's showing me some collection of my blog section.\nThat collection of my blog section can be the 5 most recent posts, my 5 most popular posts, a random smattering of blog posts, or whatever I want, but to be able to organize and filter and sift through all my blog posts and show them on my blog page, I need a some collection of them, and that collection of all my blog posts is a section.\ntemplates/base.html🔗\nOur templates directory, unsurprisingly, holds all our templates.  This is probably the part that confused me the most, so let's take a look at our base.html.\n\nThe thing that confused me about this is those block variables.  I know they aren't variables, but that's how I was thinking about them.  My idea was that base.html as the thing we serve and see, and we put other code into those block.  While this is kind of true, really we don't ever actually serve base.html rather it's a recipe for other things we serve, and we put whatever difference we want in that recipe in those code blocks.\nTyping this out, it's hard to explain my misunderstanding, but there it is.\ntemplates/index.html🔗\n\nMaybe it's the extends keyword that confused me.  I felt like this templates/index.html just adds more to to the templates/base.html file, but really it's using the base.html file as a template to make it's own index.html template.\nThis file will become our index page for the whole website or the thing we see first when we visit the website at its domain.  This is what we see when we go to mywebsite.com\ncontent/blog/_index.md🔗\nThe content directory is where we get all our stuff to be served up.  Each directory within the content directory represents a collection, or a section, of pages if that directory has a _index.md file.\nThis file that makes a directory into a section gives us basic information about the section.  Our content/blog/_index.md file should look as follows.\n\nThe title is giving us the title of the section.  The sort_by is giving us the order in which this collection of pages, that is the pages within our content/blog directory, will be given to us when we call upon it.\nThe template is saying what we will serve when we go to the blog url ourwebsite.com/blog.\nThe page_template is giving us the template we'll use whenever we serve up a blog like ourwebsite.com/blog/my-post-about-zola.\ntemplates/blog.html🔗\n\nThis is the template for the blog page mywebsite.com/blog, the page that's going to show some collection of our blog posts.  That collection can be the 5 most popular posts, the first 3 lines and the title of our 3 most recent posts, the whole of our 5 oldest posts, whatever we want.\nIt's also using the base.html for how it should look because base.html is giving us the very most basic webpage.  Just some meta data and the title of the blog and some organization.  Instead of having to type out that html in the base.html file over and over again, we've got a little template that we pretty much make every page within our website with.  It's convenient that way.\nThe section.pages is giving us access to our blog section and the pages within that section.  How does this page know that the blog section is the one we want to get the pages from?\nIt knows from the TOML information we have in our content/blog/_index.md file.\ntemplates/blog-page.html🔗\nThe following is how every one of our blogs in our /content/blog directory will be served up when we visit the page mywebsite.com/blog/a-post-about-zola.\n\nAn actual blog post🔗\n\nIf you look at our templates/blog-page.html which our content/blog/_index.md references as the template for all our blog posts, it refers to our page's titel and date and content. Well that frontmatter at the top of our blog post tells that template the information we need to put page.title and page.date into our post.\nThe content is everything after the second set of +++.\nUpdating templates/index.html🔗\nWe want to actually see our blog posts when we visit the webpage's initial webpage at mywebsite.com so we'll update the templates/index.html file as follows.\n\nThing I can't put is a line that, when rendered by this zola website messes up the parsing, so I left it out.  There's some way to escape it, but I don't wanna figure that out, and that special block of code can be found at Zola's documentary overview.\nSummary🔗\nThere's a bunch of templates, and section definitions referencing various templates and html being referenced within in templates that aren't server but are they themselves recipes and... just a bunch of confusion.\nWriting this has been a very good way for me to get through that confusion so I have a basic understanding of the structure of not just a Zola static web generator but basically most static website generators.\nI doubt this could possibly help anyone besides myself, but hopefully, if I ever have any confusion, I can look back on this to try to understand the stuff a little better.\n","id":"https://whynom.github.io/blog/the-basics-of-zola/","title":"The very basics of zola"}},"docInfo":{"https://whynom.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/a-rust-cli-application/":{"body":497,"title":3},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/binary-search-grokking-algorithms/":{"body":396,"title":4},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/didset-willset/":{"body":305,"title":3},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/get-and-set-in-swift/":{"body":348,"title":4},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/impetus-for-using-grdb/":{"body":645,"title":3},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/my-first-github-repo/":{"body":123,"title":3},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/quick-sort-and-lessons-learned/":{"body":334,"title":4},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/swift-app-without-xcode-but-with-testing/":{"body":602,"title":8},"https://whynom.github.io/blog/the-basics-of-zola/":{"body":677,"title":3}},"length":11},"lang":"English"}
